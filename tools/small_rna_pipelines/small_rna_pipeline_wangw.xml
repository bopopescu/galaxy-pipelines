**What it does**

This is a Small RNAs mapping pipeline

**Example**

Inserts file: /isilon_temp/weng/fuy2/public/Phil.SRA.PiwiIPago3hets.unox.ovary.inserts.trimmed

3' adaptor sequence: TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG

Minimum lengths of inserts: 18

Maximum lengths of inserts: 34

Number of mismatches allowed: 0

FEMALE sample: Yes

Your email address: youremail@provider.com

You should specify paths on the HPCC.

The final output is on the cluster. The two jobs on the right panel just indicate intermediate files. You can safely ignore them.

Step 1: Extract the sequencing reads from the tar ball
-------------------------------------------------------

Unzip the files and prepare the inputfile to submit the job

Usually what you get from the sequencing machine is a gzip file. 

step 1: mkdir newdir; mv filename.tar.gz newdir; cd newdir; tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz

step 2: cut -f5 \*seq.txt > temp; /home/xuj1/pipeline/uniq.reads+ temp > filename (eg. Ago3IP)

It merges the same seqs to a single line with the # of reads as 2nd col.

Sometimes the \*seq.txt files are not in the current directory, you should go into the directory that contains \*seq.txt.

Step 2: Submit the job to hpcc01
--------------------------------------------------

Example:

Output directory: /home/xuj1/nearline

Inserts file: **TODO**

3' adaptor sequence:

TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG

Minimum length of the inserts: 18
Maximum length of the inserts: 29

Number of mismatch allowed: 0

FEMALE sample: Yes

Your email address (when it's done, it would automatically send an email to your account): XX.XXX@umassmed.edu

Final Output
------------------------------------------------------------

1. OUTPUT folder
----------------

In the output directory you specified, under the same directory of your input directory there is a directory called "output". All the useful output are there.

It contains:

a. log file: print out the running time for each process

b. lendis figures: 

y species:
filename.match2_all.out.uniq.lendis.pdf --> lendis of the genome mapping inserts
filename.xk.match2_all.out.uniq.lendis.pdf --> lendis of the genome mapping inserts excluding knownRNAs
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.uniq.lendis.pdf --> lendis of the genome mapping inserts excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
by reads:
filename.match2_all.out.reads.lendis.pdf --> lendis of the genome mapping inserts
filename.xk.match2_all.out.reads.lendis.pdf --> lendis of the genome mapping inserts excluding knownRNAs
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.reads.lendis.pdf --> lendis of the genome mapping inserts excluding knownRNAs and hairpins

filename.xkxh.transposon.mapper2.lendis2.pdf -->  the transposon mapping smallRNAs lendis excluding knownRNAs and hairpins (sense: blue on top, antisense: red on bottom)
   
\*.lendis \*.lendis2 are the raw numbers that are used to plot the figures. 

c. tables:

filename_stats_table_species: sequencing stats by species
filename_stats_table_reads: sequencing stats by reads 
filename.annot_table.species: annotation stats by species
filename.annot_table.reads: annotation stats by reads
filename.annot_table.norm.species: annotation stats by species normalized by NTM(number of times mapped to the genome) and NTA (number of annotations)
filename.annot_table.norm.reads: annotation stats by reads normalized by NTM(number of times mapped to the genome) and NTA (number of annotations)

2. Intermediate files
---------------------

We keep all the useful information in the same directory of your input directory.

2.1 general

filename --> your input file
filename.uniq.reads --> the inserts of your sample 

2.2 mapping

filename.antimRNA.mapper  --> map to antisense mRNAs ( 1st col as seq, 2nd col as # of reads, the other cols indicates where it maps to)
filename.snmRNA.mapper  --> map to sense mRNAs
filename.mRNA.mapper --> map to mRNAs
filename.exon.mapper  --> map to exons
filename.intron.mapper --> map to introns
filename.intergenic.mapper --> map to intergenic regions
filename.knownRNA.mapper --> map to knownRNAs
filename.hairpin.mapper --> map to hairpins
filename.match2_all.out --> map to the genome
filename.norm.bed --> map to the genome in the bed format (chr/start/end/strand/seq/#ofreads/# of times mapped to the genome)
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out --> map to the genome excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.transposon.mapper2 --> map to the transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins,USED TO GENERATE BUCKETS

2.3 uniq.reads ( 1st col as unique species, 2nd col as # of reads)

filename.match2_all.out.uniq.reads  -->  all the seqs mapped to the genome
filename.xk.match2_all.out.uniq.reads --> genome mapping seqs excluding knownRNAs
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.uniq.reads --> genome mapping seqs excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.21nt.uniq.reads --> genome mapping 21mers excluding knownRNAs and hairpins (siRNAs)
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.23-29nt.uniq.reads --> genome mapping 23-29mers excluding knownRNAs and hairpins (piRNAs)
filename.xkxh.transposon.mapper2.uniq.reads --> all genome mapping seqs map to transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins 
filename.xkxh.antimRNA.mapper.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to antisense mRNAs excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.antimRNA.overlaptrans.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to antisense mRNAs that overlap with transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.snmRNA.mapper.uniq.reads  --> all seqs mapped to sense mRNAs excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.snmRNA.overlaptrans.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to sense mRNAs that overlap with transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.exon.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to exons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.exon.overlaptrans.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to exons that overlap with transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.intergenic.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to intergenic regions excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.intergenic.overlaptrans.uniq.reads  --> all seqs mapped to intergenic regions that overlap with transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.intron.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to introns excluding knownRNAs and hairpins 
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.intron.overlaptrans.uniq.reads --> all seqs mapped to introns that overlap with transposons excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
filename.xkxh.match2_all.out.noannot.uniq.reads --> all genome mapping seqs that don't have any annotations excluding knownRNAs and hairpins
